	  <h3> Driving Skills </h3>
	  <p>
		  I'm very good at driving vehicles. Give me anything with an engine, and I can control it well.
		  I've been riding dirtbikes for my whole life, so I'm really good, and could probably go pro if I wanted
		  I can feel exactly how the car handles, and how far I can push it, or where limits are.

	  <h3> Work Ethic </h3> 
	  <p>
		  I work hard, and worked as a ranch hand for a few years at my families' ranch.
		  I work at Jiffy Lube, and work about 20 hrs a week, and I love it
		  I'm working on getting a KTM 350 sxf running, and I've put alot of time and effort into it
		  I love working on my car and putting cool things on it.

	  <h3> My Best Friends </h3>
	  <p>
		  My cousin Spencer is for sure my best friend, we've been friends for my whole life.
		  Landen is also one of my best friends. Me and Spencer sort of adopted him in.
		  Anna is one of my best friends, and is super fun to do everything with.
