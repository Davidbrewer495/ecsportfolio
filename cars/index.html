	   <h2>How I became interested in cars</h2>

	   <p>
		   When I look back on my childhood, I always picture 3 things. Learning how to ride a motorcycle, my little grey powerwheels truck, and  
		   my little wooden radio flyer bike. Those were all key parts in my childhood. Especially the truck. My dad helped me build 2 wooden 
		   trailers with strap points, and I would load up my bike, tow it around, then unload it and ride it, as if I was going on a real
		   motorcycle trip. As I got older, I got better at riding motorcycles, and driving cars. By the time I actually got my permit, I 
		   had already driven cars alot, and  knew exactly how to handle them. These were key points in my early life that made me
		   interested in what I am today.
